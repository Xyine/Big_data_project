Hosted by Neil Cavuto, FNC's business news vice president, the program covers the latest breaking news and business stories of the day, in addition to giving analysis on how the stock market moved through the day. It also covers political stories, such as how political actions may affect the markets, in addition to analysis of the markets by a group of analysts from one of the Cost of Freedom business block programs. Closing the program, the show has a commentary segment called \"Common Sense\", in which Neil gives his point of view on a news story of the day. The program is broadcast live weekdays at 4 pm ET. Your World began broadcasting in 720p HD September 28, 2009. This HD conversion was part of FNC's network-wide switch to a 16:9 widescreen format on that day. Also on September 28, 2009, this program (which was one of the last existing weekday programs to convert to HD) debuted a new on-air look, along with new graphics and a then-new program logo.</p>",

The show premiered in July 2011, replacing the <i>Glenn Beck</i> program, and airs on weekdays at 5:00 p.m. ET with replays at 4:00 a.m. ET. On October 3, 2011, after successful ratings and high popularity, Fox News announced that <i>The Five</i> would become the permanent 5 p.m. series, as the program had previously been announced to last only during the summer. <i>The Five </i>is currently the second-most-watched program in all of cable news in the United States, placing only behind <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>, also on the Fox News Channel. The program has occasionally been the number one rated cable news series in the key 25 to 54 viewing demographic.</p>",

They have seconds to plan and 30 minutes to cook an amazing course with the basket of mystery ingredients given to them moments before the clock starts ticking! And the pressure doesn't stop there. Once they've completed their dish, they've got to survive the Chopping Block where our three judges are waiting to be wowed and not shy about voicing their culinary criticisms! Our host, Ted Allen, leads this high-energy, high-pressure show that will have viewers rooting for a winner and cheering for the losers. <i>Chopped</i> is a game of passion, expertise and skill \u2014 and in the end, only one chef will survive the Chopping Block.

            "summary": "<p><i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i> was a live television show on Fox News Channel in the United States, hosted by Sean Hannity and Alan Colmes, who respectively presented a conservative and liberal perspective. The series premiered on October 7, 1996, and the final episode aired on January 9, 2009. It was the precursor to the <b>Hannity </b>program, which airs in the same time slot. The show offered Hannity's conservative views and Colmes's liberal views incorporated into a current news story, or in conjunction with a featured guest.</p><p>In addition to politics, the show featured debate about soft news stories, such as the 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal or the death of Anna Nicole Smith, or one-on-one interviews with politicians, commonly with the host who most closely shared the guest's political ideology. The show's format resembled a former CNN show called <i>Crossfire</i>, which similarly had co-hosts on both the left and right.</p><p>Fox announced on November 24, 2008 that Alan Colmes would leave the show at the end of the year, but he remains a commentator on Fox News, runs the blog Liberaland, and makes occasional appearances on other programs like <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>, and Shovio.com's <i>TalkBackTV</i>. On December 11, it was announced that Hannity would take over the time slot alone with a new show simply titled <i>Hannity</i>, which would have a format closer to his weekend program <i>Hannity's America</i>. January 9, 2009 was the last airing of <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i>, with January 12 marking the beginning of the new <i>Hannity</i> program.</p>",

Since 2020, Dr. Travis Taylor along with Erik Bard and their investigative team have been working around the clock to collect, analyze and decode as much data as possible associated with the phenomenon occurring at the site. Their experiments have yielded amazing results, but not enough to fully unlock the secret of the ranch. So, for the first time ever they have decided to expand their search for answers. In an effort to gain a broader perspective and build larger data sets, the Skinwalker team is adding two team members and taking the offensive by pursuing evidence of similar phenomena found at analogous sites around the country. No longer content to sit, waiting to be targeted\u2026it's time to go Beyond Skinwalker.\u00a0</p>",

            "summary": "<p>Stephen Colbert brings his signature satire and comedy to\u00a0<b>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</b>, the #1 show in late-night. Featuring bandleader Jon Batiste with his band Stay Human, the Emmy Award-nominated show broadcasts from the historic Ed Sullivan Theater. He talks with an eclectic mix of guests about what is new and relevant in the worlds of politics, entertainment, business, music, technology, and more. Stephen Colbert took over as host, executive producer, and writer of The Late Show on Sept. 8, 2015.\u00a0</p><p>Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and lest known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Before joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced ko\u028al\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one-third of the time. Good luck, Bill!</p>",
