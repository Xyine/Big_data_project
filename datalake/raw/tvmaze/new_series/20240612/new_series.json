The program is currently co-hosted by Joe Kernen, Rebecca Quick, and Andrew Ross Sorkin. Since debuting in 1995, the show has spawned a number of versions across CNBC's international channels, many of which employ a similar format. The program title originates from a term used in investment banks and stock brokerages for a permanent voice circuit or intercom used to communicate stock deals or sales priorities; it also may refer to the squawk of a bird, like a peacock, which is the logo of CNBC.</p>",

Hosted by Neil Cavuto, FNC's business news vice president, the program covers the latest breaking news and business stories of the day, in addition to giving analysis on how the stock market moved through the day. It also covers political stories, such as how political actions may affect the markets, in addition to analysis of the markets by a group of analysts from one of the Cost of Freedom business block programs. Closing the program, the show has a commentary segment called \"Common Sense\", in which Neil gives his point of view on a news story of the day. The program is broadcast live weekdays at 4 pm ET. Your World began broadcasting in 720p HD September 28, 2009. This HD conversion was part of FNC's network-wide switch to a 16:9 widescreen format on that day. Also on September 28, 2009, this program (which was one of the last existing weekday programs to convert to HD) debuted a new on-air look, along with new graphics and a then-new program logo.</p>",

On October 3, 2011, after successful ratings and high popularity, Fox News announced that <i>The Five</i> would become the permanent 5 p.m. series, as the program had previously been announced to last only during the summer. <i>The Five </i>is currently the second-most-watched program in all of cable news in the United States, placing only behind <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>, also on the Fox News Channel. The program has occasionally been the number one rated cable news series in the key 25 to 54 viewing demographic.</p>",

            "summary": "<p><i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i> was a live television show on Fox News Channel in the United States, hosted by Sean Hannity and Alan Colmes, who respectively presented a conservative and liberal perspective. The series premiered on October 7, 1996, and the final episode aired on January 9, 2009. It was the precursor to the <b>Hannity </b>program, which airs in the same time slot. The show offered Hannity's conservative views and Colmes's liberal views incorporated into a current news story, or in conjunction with a featured guest.</p><p>In addition to politics, the show featured debate about soft news stories, such as the 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal or the death of Anna Nicole Smith, or one-on-one interviews with politicians, commonly with the host who most closely shared the guest's political ideology. The show's format resembled a former CNN show called <i>Crossfire</i>, which similarly had co-hosts on both the left and right.</p><p>Fox announced on November 24, 2008 that Alan Colmes would leave the show at the end of the year, but he remains a commentator on Fox News, runs the blog Liberaland, and makes occasional appearances on other programs like <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>, and Shovio.com's <i>TalkBackTV</i>. On December 11, it was announced that Hannity would take over the time slot alone with a new show simply titled <i>Hannity</i>, which would have a format closer to his weekend program <i>Hannity's America</i>. January 9, 2009 was the last airing of <i>Hannity &amp; Colmes</i>, with January 12 marking the beginning of the new <i>Hannity</i> program.</p>",

Featuring bandleader Jon Batiste with his band Stay Human, the Emmy Award-nominated show broadcasts from the historic Ed Sullivan Theater. He talks with an eclectic mix of guests about what is new and relevant in the worlds of politics, entertainment, business, music, technology, and more. Stephen Colbert took over as host, executive producer, and writer of The Late Show on Sept. 8, 2015.\u00a0</p><p>Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and lest known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Before joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced ko\u028al\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one-third of the time. Good luck, Bill!</p>",
